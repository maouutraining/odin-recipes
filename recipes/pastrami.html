    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pastrami is a staple at delis, commonly Jewish American delis, and is most often sliced for sandwiches, 
        like this Marathon Sandwich or these Pastrami Football Finger Sandwiches.

        Pastrami is made from beef brisket that has been cured, coated in spices, cold smoked and then steamed. 
        Pastrami's thick coat of spices typically includes crushed black pepper, coriander, mustard seeds, garlic 
        and other spices that might be included in a pickling spice mixture.
